### Formik

Build forms in React, without the tears.

- Official Web – https://formik.org/

* GitHub – https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik

- NPM – https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik

`Formik` is one of the most popular form libraries for React and React Native. With `Formik’s` powerful features you spend less time building powerful complex forms. Features are,

- It works well with both internal states and external state libraries.
- It provides well integrated validations and supports external libraries like `Yup`.
- It works well with controlled and uncontrolled form components.
- It is easy to customize the form and its behaviours.

`Formik` has well written documentation. It doesn’t have an active community as much as `React Hook Form` but it’s more active than `React Final Form` (03/12/2024) in 2024. `Formik` learning curve is not as easy as `React Hook Form` but it doesn’t have a steep learning curve as `React Final Form`.

But I found a few considerations,

- Formik has a 690 open bugs on the GitHub when today (03/12/2024) – https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues.
- Formik bundle size is larger than React Hook Form.
